          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Wrocław Bike Stats is a hobby project aimed at creating an online tool for analyzing the usage of city bikes in Wrocław, Poland. It is a "data sandbox project" designed for experimenting, testing, and learning various technologies related to data analysis, data engineering, and data science.

          <h2>Why Wrocław?</h2>
          <p>
            Wrocław is the only city in Poland that provides open public data on daily rides from its bike-sharing system. That is why the choice fell on Wrocław&mdash;it had easily accessible data in the form of ready-to-use CSV files.

          <h2>Where Do the Data Come From?</h2>
          <p>
            The data come from the official service of the Wrocław City Council &mdash; Open Data Wrocław. All resources related to the Wrocław City Bike can be found here:

          <h2>Why City Bikes?</h2>
          <p>
            From my perspective, "bike data" are ideal for a sandbox project because they open up a wide range of possibilities. Simple records containing only information about a single ride simultaneously hold time series and geospatial data. Thanks to this, we can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>analyze global metrics of bike rides each day,</li>
            <li>analyze traffic at individual stations,</li>
            <li>analyze the most popular bike routes,</li>
            <li>check the rental balance at each station at the end of the day, which affects so-called "bike rebalancing",</li>
            <li>predict traffic at stations and on popular routes,</li>
            <li>analyze traffic and rentals in real time,</li>
            <li>identify bike numbers that may require servicing,</li>
            <li>determine where bike stations are needed or unnecessary,</li>
            <li>and much more.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Plans for the Future</h2>
          <p>
            The current main goal is to launch an MVP &mdash; a simple system presenting data on rides for a specific day and for any time range in 2025. In parallel, I am working on recording and processing data in real time, which should appear later. After that, I would like to focus on training an ML model to predict the number of rides each day and the final number of bikes at stations.
