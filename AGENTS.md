# AGENTS.md

- Don't start coding and working on any task specified in `docs/TASKS.md` unless explicitly instructed.
- Always read and follow `docs/SPECS.md` before doing any coding.
- Treat `docs/SPECS.md` as the single source of requirements.
- Treat `docs/TASKS.md` as the source of current project state (what is Active, what is Done).
- Never remove existing tests unless explicitly instructed.
- Only modify files within the repo; do not invent new external services.
