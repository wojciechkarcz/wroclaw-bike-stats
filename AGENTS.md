# AGENTS.md

- Always read and follow `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/TASKS.md` before doing any coding.
- Treat `SPEC.md` as the single source of requirements.
- Treat `TASKS.md` as the source of current project state (what is Active, what is Done).
- Every new code must come with at least one pytest test.
- Never remove existing tests unless explicitly instructed.
- Only modify files within the repo; do not invent new external services.
